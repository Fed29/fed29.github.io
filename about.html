## About

My name is Federico Angaramo, I'm a curious and a real enterprising person. I live in Biella (Italy) where I works on Data Science and AI projects.
I'm looking to develop my analytical skills and my knowledge, trying to implement and use state of the art algorithms to meet the aim of sperimenting and learning new things and to create new ones.
I like data science and Machine Learning and I always want to learn new things sush as programming languages, algorithms and so on, mainly in the Artificial Intelligence fields (especially Machine Learning).

In my spare time I develop the projects in this site and on my <a href="https://github.com/Fed29">GitHub</a>, in addition I like swimming and riding my bikes.

You can find more information about my experiences in <a href="/docs/Resume-Angaramo-EN.pdf">my resume</a>.
